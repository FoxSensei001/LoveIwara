### 🌟 Introduction
Love Iwara (also known as i_iwara or 2i) is a third-party mobile application for Iwara built with Flutter. Our goal is to provide users with an excellent experience, supporting multiple platforms and devices including mobile phones, tablets and computers, compatible with Android, Windows and other operating systems.

### ⚠️ Project Description
As a Flutter beginner, this is my first attempt at developing a cross-platform application. While there may be areas in the project that need improvement and code that could be optimized, the main purpose is to learn and understand Flutter development through hands-on practice.

- **Learning Objectives**
  - Familiarize with Flutter development basics
  - Understand cross-platform application development processes
  - Document insights and experiences during the learning process

- **Project Status**
  - Currently in the learning and exploration phase
  - Code may not be sufficiently standardized and complete
  - Feature implementation primarily focuses on learning purposes

- **Usage Notes**
  - This project is for learning reference only
  - Not recommended for production environment
  - Welcome discussions with other learners

- **Usage Restrictions**
  - Strictly prohibited from promotion on any platform
  - Violations will result in measures including but not limited to maintenance suspension and repository deletion

- **Known Issues**
  - Due to limited experience, the project may have room for performance optimization
  - Some features may not be fully developed
  - Suggestions for improvement are welcome

Thank you for your understanding and support! If you're also a Flutter beginner, I hope we can progress together in our learning journey.
